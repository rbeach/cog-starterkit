<p>Our goal is to provide people throughout North Texas with streamlined access to the best possible care. But how exactly do we do that? By enabling physicians of all types, from independent and faculty to employed and university-affiliated, the opportunity to come together, govern and work within our high performing network. Because working together across disciplines allows us to focus on delivering high quality, more reliable care to the people that need it.</p>
